# Maleke-Project

This is Maleke, this is my project. I organized a field trip to a cave, but something went wrong, forcing them to turn back and return to school. In this project, I added A loop and my own block, which helped with the movement of the characters, and my own block helped with Make eveything neet and making use less blocks.
